The `useAction` hook is a powerful utility for handling asynchronous actions in React applications. It provides a convenient way to manage pending states, errors, and data responses while executing actions defined with `createAction`.

## Overview

The `useAction` hook can be used in two main ways:

1. [Form Usage](./client-form-usage): Handle form submissions and manage form-specific errors.
2. [Advanced Usage](./client-advanced-usage): Execute actions directly with more control over the input.

For detailed information on the hook's parameters, return values, and types, see the [API Reference](./client-api-reference).

## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of how to use `useAction` with a form:

```tsx
import { useAction } from '@vergestack/api-react';
import { greetingAction } from './actions';

export function GreetingComponent() {
  const { data, errors, handlers } = useAction(greetingAction);

  return (
    <>
      <form {...handlers}>
        <input name="name" />
        <button type="submit">Greet</button>
      </form>

      {data && <p>Data: {data}</p>}
      {errors && <p>Errors: {errors.join(', ')}</p>}
    </>
  );
}
```

The `{...handlers}` syntax provides progressive enhancement - your form will work even if JavaScript is disabled, while enabling enhanced client-side features when JavaScript is available.
