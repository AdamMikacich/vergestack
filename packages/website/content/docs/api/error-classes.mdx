title: Error Classes
---

Custom error classes are available for throwing specific errors within your actions. These helpers provide more meaningful and standardized error responses across your application while following the familiar `throw new Error()` pattern.

## Available Custom Errors

The following custom error classes are available:

| Error Class            | Code | Description                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `UnauthorizedError`    | 401  | Used when authentication is required but not provided or is invalid.           |
| `ForbiddenError`       | 403  | Used when the authenticated user doesn't have permission to access a resource. |
| `BadRequestError`      | 400  | Used when the request is malformed or contains invalid data.                   |
| `NotFoundError`        | 404  | Used when a requested resource is not found.                                   |
| `VisibleInternalError` | 500  | Used for internal server errors that can be safely exposed to the client.      |

<Callout type="info">
  All other errors (including the native `Error`) are treated as internal server
  errors and are **not** exposed to the client.
</Callout>

Each error class shares the same common behavior, differing only in the `status` property. This determines the specific HTTP status code returned in the error response.

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `UnauthorizedError` and `ForbiddenError` classes in an action:

```typescript
import { UnauthorizedError, ForbiddenError } from '@vergestack/api';

export const authAction = createAction()
  .input(z.void())
  .output(z.void())
  .handler(async () => {
    if (!isUserAuthenticated()) {
      throw new UnauthorizedError('User is not authenticated');
    }

    if (!userHasAccess()) {
      throw new ForbiddenError('User does not have access');
    }

    // ... rest of the action logic
  });
```
