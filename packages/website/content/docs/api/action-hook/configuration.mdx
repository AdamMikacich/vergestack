title: Configuration
---

The `useAction` hook in `@vergestack/api-react` allows you to configure its behavior by passing an optional `options` object. This object can include callback functions for different stages of the action execution. These local options override the global configuration.

## Available Options

The `useAction` hook accepts an options object as its second argument with the following properties:

- `onSuccess`: Called when the action is successful
- `onError`: Called when the action encounters one or more errors
- `onComplete`: Called after the action completes, regardless of success or failure
- `initialData`: Sets the initial data state

## Usage Example

Here's an example of how to use the `useAction` hook with all available options:

```typescript
import { useAction } from '@vergestack/api-react';
import { greetingAction } from './actions';

function MyComponent() {
  const { data, errors, execute } = useAction(greetingAction, {
    initialData: 'Hello',
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      console.log('Action succeeded with data:', data);
    },
    onError: (errors) => {
      console.error('Action failed with errors:', errors);
    },
    onComplete: () => {
      console.log('Action completed');
    }
  });

  // Rest of your component code
}
```

## Callbacks

### onSuccess

The `onSuccess` callback is triggered when the action completes successfully. It receives the action's result data as its argument.

```typescript
onSuccess: (data: OutputType) => void
```

### onError

The `onError` callback is triggered when the action encounters an error. It receives a list of error objects.

```typescript
onError: (errors: ApiErrorWithMetadata[]) => void
```

### onComplete

The `onComplete` callback is executed after the action finishes, regardless of whether it succeeded or failed. It doesn't receive any arguments.

```typescript
onComplete: () => void
```

## Properties

### initialData

The `initialData` property sets the initial data state.

```typescript
initialData: OutputType;
```
